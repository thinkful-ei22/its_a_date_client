### *Let the Goodtimes roll!*

## Summary

Goodtimes is a small app designed to help friends select the time and place to hang out that works best for the group. By simply casting votes, everyone can avoid those never-ending group texts that decide nothing. Get ready to organize a get-together faster than ever before!

Goodtimes was made during a three week span as part of Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program. Members worked as a team, utilizing Agile development practices and methodology, with daily standups and weekly retrospectives.

After selecting the options for the event, Goodtimes auto-generates a form that can be publically accessed.
You can email your friends directly from the Goodtimes website and send them a bitly link that will take them to the voting form.

Users' friends can vote on the times and places that work best for them...


...and users can check the results of the votes on their dashboard.

When everyone has voted, users can let their group know which options came out on top!
